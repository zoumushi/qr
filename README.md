## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS
- Flexbox

### What I learned

That I'm overreliant on Flexbox.

### Continued development

I'd like to:
- Learn when and when not to use Flexbox
- Stop forgetting that border-box is a thing due to how useful it is

### Useful resources

- [An Interactive Guide to Flexbox](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/interactive-guide-to-flexbox/) - Really nice guide to Flexbox, also acts as a cheatsheet of sorts. When I couldn't remember something regarding Flexbox, because of the guide, I was able find the solution within seconds.
- [W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/) - HTML validator straight from the W3C. Helped me make sure I don't make any silly mistakes. They also have [other cool tools](https://www.w3.org/developers/tools/).
